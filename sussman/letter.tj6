Hello,

By way of introduction, I'm researching the ITS operating system, and
I'm trying to have much of the software running on PDP-10 emulators.
MIT Libraries have arranged access for me to CSAIL's 1Tapes of Tech
Square0 archive of PDP-10 backup tapes, but they only go back to
1971.  A few weeks ago I stumbled across something that astonished me.
It's a passage from the book 1"The Tomorrow Makers"0 from 1988.  I
have reproduced it on the next page.  It says you had a 1967 printout
of ITS.  Is that true, and if so, is there any chance you still have
it?

I'm writing mostly to ascertain whether the printout has been
preserved.  Ideally, some day I'd hope to see it scanned.  If so, I
would have it typed in, assembled, and run on a PDP-6 emulator.
However, I understand having it scanned may not be so easy, and it
would probably have to be done under carefully controlled conditions.

Best regards,

Excerpt from the book 1"The Tomorrow Makers"0, by Grant Fjermedal.

  1Then he pulled out a printout that he handled as if it were an
original Gutenberg bible.  It was the original code for the ITS
operating system - the Incompatible Timesharing System.  It even
seemed awesome to me.  Today we just accept the fact that a mainframe
computer can be in the basement of a building and desktop terminals
can be spread throughout a building, or throughout the world,
providing anyone with a terminal, access to the computer.  It is hard
to realize that as late as the 1960s this wasn't the case.  If you
wanted computer time, you wrote your program, took it to the computer
room, and had it run oftentimes by someone else, even if you wanted to
do it yourself.

  It is a tribute to the modesty and especially to the irreverence of
the early hackers that when they created the world's first timesharing
system at MIT, they provided it with a name that was completely
opposite from what it really was: the Incompatible Timesharing System.

  There was Gerry Sussman holding that half-inch printout, a blessed
relic from 1967.  The machine has a Moby memory, and as if reciting
from the opening words of the Great American novel, Sussman held the
printout in his hands and said, 0"The first line of it is, Moby is
One."1  It was written as 2MOBY=11, but the way Sussman read it,
there was the sound of poetry and philosophy, as existential a piece
of haiku as I have ever heard: Moby is One.  0"These days such an
operating system would have maybe one hundred times as much code.  But
this is what it was like then, filled with some very beautiful coded
and some very ugly code.  Some of it is humorous, and some of it is
sad.  Some of it had ideas in it that have been lost.  Some historian
could go through it someday and read it the way people read the Dead
Sea Scrolls and say, 1'Aha, The guys who wrote this were real smart
guys.  And some of the things they knew, we don't even know now.'"
